#### Summary:
From the author's startup work, the author shared their coding experience: at first they compromised on code quality in order to deliver project on time and which result in a mess work which hard to scale, then decide to rewrite the whole database. 

The author tells us few things:

1. Never compromise on code quality
Becase, when codebase become a mess work, it's hard to maintain and scale, when recode it take much longger time. So always write quality code for the future, because that extra effort we put in will save a lot of time and money in the future.
Keep a balance between introducing a library or write the library on our own. Introducing too many libraries will make a project have extra weight but write our own library will cost our time. 

2. Always document and write code comments
The new developers are more acquainted with libraries exist in the market compare to our codebase. Documentation and code comments are a must since it can make people easily comprehend your library just by reading your docs. As a code reviewer and maintainer, you have responsibility to ensure it have Documentations and code comments.

3. Don’t reinvent the wheel, unless you ensure it is maintainable
It's no point in reinventing a wheel unless you have a lot of time to document it and make it can be understand by all. If there is a library can solve your problems it's great idea to introducing it and make a contribution to it.
And there is a quote from Phil Walton’s blog: Reinventing the wheel is bad for business, but it’s great for learning.

3. Always test your codebase
Testing code is important, but it has never be easier. When the codebase becomes larger, even a single line can cause the application to break. But when testing is automated, we can be confident about the changes we push.

4. Keep learning
Libraries like React, Vue, Angular and various others open doors to other concepts like functional programming, immutability, and many others, which actually helps you become better at your craft and enhance what I know.

5. Conclusion
The pursuit for perfection is a never-ending path, but we can always strive to walk the right path.

#### Reflection:
Uncle Ben once told Peter Parker, “With great power comes great responsibility”. Never too much to learn and with this knowledge we empowered ourself and becoming more adaptive to the world we live in.
