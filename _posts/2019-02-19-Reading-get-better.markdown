#### Introduction:
The importance of relationship. An organization’s greatest assets are its people. And relationships between those people that create the culture and become an organization’s ultimate competitive advantage. At both the individual and organizational levels, nearly everything get better when we focus on strengthening relationships. But there are old habits and biases standing in the way, keep us stuck without an exit, and it feel like hell. The author have chosen fifteen practices from his experience that he believes have had the most significant impact and share them with us.

#### Reflection:
Practice 1: Wear glasses that work.
Choosing how we see ourselves and others has a cascading effect on what we think. And this concept is a foundational principle for making significant changes in our lives. For example, when seeing someone with the strength and capability, we changed our strategey to focus on them, then our feeling to them changed and we have confidence in them, and with that confidence, he succeed in doing the job.

Practice 2: Carry your own weather.
'Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms - to choose one's attitude in any given set of circumstatnces, to choose one's own way.'
At the foundation of carrying your own weather is the ablility to pasuse between stimulus and response. We have the ability to see and evaluate our own thoughts. We pause, step back, and see ourselves along with the paradigms we adopt and use. In effect, it gives us the freedom to proactively choose our response.

Practice 3: Behave your way to credibility.
Increasing competence often requires that we step outside our comfort zone. Transitory actions may build confidence in others, but trust only comes from seeing the consistency of such actions over time. So we need to take the long-term view.

Practice 4: Play your roles well.
A nurse lists the top five deathbed regrets as:
1. I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expect of me.
2. I wish I hadn't worked so hard.
3. I wish I had stayed in touch with my friends.
4. I wish that I had let myself be happier.
Our roles are never just about what we do but are ways through which we express our values and who we are at our core.
To get better at playing your roles well, you need to first identify them, then determine the real contribution you want to make in each one. Once you've identified your most meaningful roles, you're able to determine how and when you want to show up in those roles.

Practice 5: See the tree, not just the seeding
To see the potential in others requires us to believe that the seed, with the right kind of nourishment, will become the mighty oak. When you believe in the potential of others, you help them see more clearly what they are capable of, enage their strengths and talents that may be lying dormant, and ultimately allow them to become the people they want to be.

Practice 6: Avoid the Pinball Syndrome
Important things are those that contribute to our values and align to our highest goals. The nature of the pinball syndrome is to confuse urgency with importance. 
Here are two suggestions for delay gratification and take the long-term view.
1. set goals that matter.
2. Choose your weekly priorities carefully.

Few strategies to prevent us from getting sucked into people-created urgencies.
1. Block your schedule.
2. Reflect on your day.
3. Be ready for drop-ins.

Practice 7: Think we, not me
At FranklinCovey, we teach about three levels of maturity: dependence, independence, and interdependence. 
We define our thoughts respectfully, and consideration as our willingness and ability to seek and listen to others' thoughts and feelings with respects. Too much consideration without enough courage can turn you into a so-called pushover or doormat. Too much courage without enough consideration can turn you into a bully. So we need maintain a balance of both in every situation and make sure you'ar not dramatically weighted toward one side or the other.

Practice 8: Take stock of your Emotional Bank Accounts
The goal of the EBA is to only make depposits and build trust with others. Emotional Bank Accounts don't allow for automated deposits. High trust, good will, and full engagement are the ultimate outcome of the EBA. 
When we make deposits into an EBA, it requires that we're deliberate and consistent. Relationships grow in security and trust when they are built with intentional, meaningful, ongoing contributions rather than the occasional making grand gesture. Many people get so good at consistently making small deposits that doing so becomes a part of who they are. This stockpile of good can be invaluable when we go through th inevitable trials life presents.

Practice 9: Examine your real motives
Motives are the underlying reasons for the actions you take and the words you say. There are healthy and unhealthy motives:
Healthy motive: any motive that uplifts the human condition in ourselves and others.
Unhealthy motives: any motive that degrades the human condition in ourselves and others.
We need examine our motives on a regular basis, otherwise, our motives can end up being unhealty, driven by fear, anger, or sadness in the one moment and, in the next, by an unfulfilled need for acceptance, power, or safety.
There are three things will help you examine your real motives:
1. Use the 5 Whys.
2. Choose abundance.
3. Declare your intent.

Practice 10: Talk less, listen more
Making quick decisions and judgment calls will often lead to misdiagnosed solutions, faulty assumptions, narrow perspectives, and misunderstood facts. As a result, we deprive others of the opportunity to solve problems on their own. When we fail to take time to truly listen, we threaten trust.
Being truly present provides a safe environment in which people can learn to listen to themselves, assess their own behavior, diagnose their own problems, and come up with their own solutions.
One of the most profound gifts you can give another human being is your sincere understanding. With people, fast is slow and slow is fast.

Practice 11: Get your volume right
We all have natural strengths. Strengths may like influence, power, intensity, and potency. Utilizing and nurturing our quique bundle of strengths is a fundamental part of who we are. Whether as talents we were born with or skills we developed over time, our strengths are often our go-to way for getting things done. 
However, we grow accustomed to using certain strengths and rely on those even more. And which can start working against us if we have its volume turned too high.

Practice 12: Extend trust
If you trust, you will be disappointed occasionally, but if you mistrust, you will be miserable all the time.
There is risk in everything. You can get burned by people to whom you've extended great trust, but there's so much more to be gained by leading with trust over suspicion.

Practice 13: Make it safe to tell the truth
Why do we resist feedback? Why don't we have the courage to ask for it in the first place? For most of us, setting ourselves up to receive what we see as criticism is unpleasant at best, and confidence-deflating at worst. So we choose not to create opportunities for what we assume will be negative feedback from others. We all know how hard it is to give ourselves feedback, but it can be overwhelming, even paralyzing, to get it from someone else.

There are four ways to make it safer to let others to tell your the truth.
1. Assume good intent.
2. Ask for feedback.
3. Evaluate the feedback.
4. Act on it.

Practice 14: Align inputs with outputs
While many inputs might contribute to the desired output, identifying the right inputs can make all the difference. 
A five-step process we can employ:
1. Describe the output you want.
2. Assess the current reality.
3. Examine the inputs.
4. Pick the 'lead measure' inputs you think will most likely achieve the desired output.
5. Analyze the result. 

Practice 15: Start with humility
Above all other character qualities, humility is foundational. 
Those who are humble have a secure sense of self-their validation doesn't come from something external, but is based on their true nature. To be humble means to shed one's ego, because the authentic self is much greater than looking good, needing to have all the answers, or being recognized by one's peers. As a result, those who have cultivated humility as an attribute have far greater energy to devote to others. They go from being consumed with themselves to looking for ways to contribute and help others. Humility is key to building solid character and strong, meaningful connections.
Humility keeps me curious-in a state of continuous learning. Humility is why I treat the front receptionist with the same respect as I treat the CEO. Humility helps me forgive. Humility tells me there are many right solutions to solving the same problem. Humility invites me to pay it forward. Humility makes me feel grateful for who I am and what I have. Humility prompts me to ask for help when I need it. Humility helps me stop worrying about myself and start thinking about others. Humility allows me to let go of a hurt feeling. Humility gives me courage to be honst with a co-worker in a respctful way. Humility is the wisdom needed to accurately assess my strengths and weaknesses. Humility reminds me to be patient with myself and others, and to know that we are all in the process of getting better. Humility tells me that while I'm important, I'm only one part of a much bigger picture.
