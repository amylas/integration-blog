Sorry for the late presentation for which I would like blame the procrastination of humanity. There are something I would like to talk about after last 2 weeks' work, after think through.

Firstly, why do we need a retro or even further why do we need scrum? The question is when projects becoming really complex and more integrated than they used to, they are at same time getting harder for us to develop without the whole view of it. Then we need srum, a project developed with every small step, but without waiting or with little intervals, to progress. In this way, a project progressed with a big leap through a large time span. After every release of a project, we take a break, reflect what we did and commit to do well in the next sprint. Kudos is part of a retro, which is important, for it can easily build up a person's confidence and be prepared for the oncoming development work.

Secondly, we do review with our leader every month and every quarter, Does it necessary or helped? I think so. The question is we always do but with no reflection. There is a saying that just do it, so we work continually and ceaselessly but with no progress, how comes? Without refection, how we know we didn't do the wrong thing or in the wrong direction, without refection, how we get to know the best way to progress instead of using the method in the subconsciousness mind? With reflection or with deep-mind thinking, we are superman, we do the right thing, work effectively and make a progress. We are geniuses only happens when we work with our mind thinking. When we go through a review, we review the past work, the ongoing work and goals. At that time, it always pushes me to think critically of what I did in past month, what can I do now and how can I accomplish that? And at same time I would make up my mind to do more and set a goal for the next month.

Thirdly, Why should we to be a owner, do we have to? 

Fourthly, Why we do research work, does it important?

We will talk about that in the next presentation, thank you!
