[Article Link](2018-11-30-Reading: The-dilemma-of-Class-solidification)

#### Summary:
The Article is pretty realistic and insightful but not very persuasive due to the length of the article. At first, the auther showed us a fact that class-solidification is becoming a topic and was talked everywhere. Then he showed us how everything in reality turning into a trick and made us trapped in the dilema of class-solidification. The author also gave us the ultimate solution of how to cope with it and get escaped from it. The solution is, in one word, self-cognition, believe in yourself and believe you can make it and it will finally becoming a reality since reality is only a representation of the world in your mind.


#### Reflection:
I think we all should believe like the believe of holy bible, deep inside and without doubt. You can't change the outside world without change yourself first, so you gonna change yourself and the world will be changed itself. You have to believe yourself that you can do anything then you achieved it, that's the secret of success. There is a saying that why can't live a good life for knowing so many senses. The question is believe is far from enough, you have to convince yourself to believe, believed without doubts. We think we believe actually we are not, there are still doubts, questions, so we need self-cognition, to think what we think, to rebuild our congnition. 
The world is what we think, so think.
